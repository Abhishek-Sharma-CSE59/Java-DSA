    "**History of Java**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java’s history is as interesting as it is impactful. The journey of this powerful programming language began in **1991** when **James Gosling**, **Mike Sheridan**, and **Patrick Naughton**, a team of engineers at **Sun Microsystems** known as the **“Green Team,”** set out to create a new language initially called **“Oak”**, Oak was later renamed **Java**, inspired by **Java coffee**, and was first publicly released in **1996** as **Java 1.0**.\n",
    "- **Arthur Van Hoff** rewrote the Java 1.0 compiler to strictly comply with its specifications, ensuring its reliability and cross-platform capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *TimeLine* :-\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Java evolved over time, with Java 2 introducing multiple configurations tailored for different platforms, showcasing its versatility.\n",
    "    In 1997, Sun Microsystems aimed to formalize Java through the ISO standards body but eventually withdrew from the process.\n",
    "    - Despite not formalizing through ISO, Sun Microsystems offered most Java implementations at no cost, earning revenue by licensing specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.\n",
    "    - A significant milestone in Java’s history occurred on November 13, 2006, when Sun Microsystems released a large portion of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as free, open-source software.\n",
    "    - By May 8, 2007, the core JVM code was fully available under open-source distribution terms.\n",
    "    - Java was designed with core principles: simplicity, robustness, security, high performance, portability, multi-threading, and dynamic interpretation. These principles have made - Java a preferred language for various applications, including mobile devices, internet programming, gaming, and e-business.\n",
    "    - Today, Java continues to be a cornerstone of modern software development, widely used across industries and platforms."

    "**Key Features of Java**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Platform Independent\n",
    "    - Compiler converts source code to byte code and then the JVM excutes the bytecode generated by the compiler.\n",
    "    - The byte code can run on any platform be it Windows, Linux, or macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented Programming**\n",
    "    - Java is a Object-Oriented Language, Promoting the use of Objects and classes\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Four concepts of Object-Oriented Programming are:\n",
    "        - Abstraction\n",
    "        - Encasulation\n",
    "        - Inheritance\n",
    "        - Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**\n",
    "    - Java Syntax is simple and easy to learn, especially for those familiar with C or C++. \n",
    "    - It eliminated complex features like pointers and multiple inheritances, making it easier to write , debug and maintain code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness**\n",
    "    - Robust which means reliable\n",
    "    - The main Features of java that make it robust are garbage collection, exception handling, and memory allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security**\n",
    "    - In java, we don’t have pointers, so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception if we try to do so. That’s why several security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow are impossible to exploit in Java. Also, java programs run in an environment that is independent of the os(operating system) environment which makes java programs more secure.\n",

    "- **High Performance**\n",
    "    - Java architecture is defined in such a way that it reduces overhead during the runtime and at some times java uses Just In Time (JIT) compiler where the compiler compiles code on-demand basis where it only compiles those methods that are called making applications to execute faster.\n",
